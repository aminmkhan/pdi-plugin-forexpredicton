#This config file is divided in two parts. 
#The first parameters refer to the technical analysis features used to fill the provided datasets
#The second part refers to hyperparameters used by each created GBT model
#The specified parameters are going to be the same for each provided csv/model
#It is not needed to specify the two types of parameters. However, when one starts to specify a parameter of this type, all the other ones of that type need to be specified
